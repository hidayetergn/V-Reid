# Adaptive-Vehicle-Re-Identification-via-Operational-Attention-and-Multi-Part-Embedding
An Operational Transformer with Global-Fusion Attention Module (OT-GFAM) introduces ONN-based nonlinear projections into windowed and shifted-window attention.  A Global-Local Multi-Part Embedding (GLPE) decomposes feature maps into global, half-stripe, and third-stripe regions.
